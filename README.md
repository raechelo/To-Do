# To-Do
was a small project I took on over a school break in order to help solidify my knowledge of Javascript. I also started this project to work on my newly learned skills of jQuery and to see how powerful and useful this framework is.

This project was assigned in a Udemy course that I purchased. I took the base model and recreated it without completing any lessons alongside the project. I am really proud of what I was able to accomplish with this project on my own and as my first project using jQuery.

# What I Learned
jQuery is super handy! It seems to allow for so much styling and event handling. I was able to do so much with so few lines of code! jQuery seems so powerful.

# What's to Come
I wish I had been able to get the functionality to work on the dynamically created elements, like the new list items. I have a few resoucres to reference to see if I can work this kink out.
