# To-Do
was a small project I took on over a school break in order to help solidify my knowledge of Javascript. I also started this project to work on my newly learned skills of jQuery and to see how powerful and useful this framework is.

# What I Learned
jQuery is super handy! It seems to allow for so much styling and event handling.
